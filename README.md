- 👋 Hi, I’m @ancocco
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, website maintenance, content management and programming and designing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python for data analysis purposes. I love reviewing public data from governmental and public csv files, 
      explore the data and deploy them in graphs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pollution data exploration projects and statistical analytics of social factors like employment versus incidental factors
      like pandemcis, crisis, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me sending an email to coccosc@hotmail.com
